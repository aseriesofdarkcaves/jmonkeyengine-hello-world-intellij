# [HelloAnimation](https://wiki.jmonkeyengine.org/docs/3.3/tutorials/beginner/hello_animation.html)
Introduction to animation.

The tutorial for this shows code that use deprecated interfaces and classes.
The sample code itself doesn't even run because there's a NullPointerException.

When I find out what the correct replacement for the deprecated classes are I will
update this.
