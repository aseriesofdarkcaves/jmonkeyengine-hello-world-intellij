# [HelloMaterials](https://wiki.jmonkeyengine.org/docs/3.3/tutorials/beginner/hello_material.html)
Introduction to materials.

There's a lot of code in here that uses String literals to configure various aspects of the materials.
There is an alternative way to
[configure materials](https://wiki.jmonkeyengine.org/docs/3.3/core/material/j3m_material_files.html).
The [JME 3 Material Specification](https://wiki.jmonkeyengine.org/docs/3.3/core/material/material_specification.html)
is helpful here too. This means that as well as being able to configure materials in-code,
their properties can be defined externally and loaded in by referencing a file.
